2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```
3.**Add Your API Key:**


Create a `config.js` file in the project root directory.
Add the following line to `config.js` (replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key):

const API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
```

## Note

> **Important:** Make sure not to commit your `config.js` file with your API key to the repo to keep your API key secure.
> I have used a free API key from `cohere` that has its limitations, you can use one of your choice.
